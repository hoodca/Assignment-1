Date Range Tracker

Purpose

This script tracks a date range represented by integer dates in yyyymmdd format and prints the start and end dates in human-readable ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd).

Input

* A range of dates represented as integers in yyyymmdd format (e.g., 20200122 to 20201207).

Expected Output

* The earliest and latest dates from the input range printed in ISO date format:

  
  Start date: 2020-01-22
  End date: 2020-12-07
  

Type of Execution

* Run as a standalone Python script.
* No external dependencies or modules are required.

Possible Improvements

* Accept dynamic input for date ranges instead of hardcoded values.
* Add validation and error handling for invalid or out-of-order date ranges.
* Support additional date formats or time components.
* Implement unit tests for the helper function and date range processing.
* Extend functionality to perform operations on the date range (e.g., counting days, filtering weekends).
